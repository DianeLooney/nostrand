## Usage

```
nos FUNCTION [ARG...]
```

Nostrand does one thing: it runs a function.

Functions are Clojure functions. Without a namespace, they resolve to the `nostrand.tasks` namespace which is built in.

```
$ nos version
Nostrand 0.0.1.6940 (master/a1e4260* Mon Nov 28 03:51:20 EST 2016)
Mono 4.8.0 (mono-4.8.0-branch/f5fbc32 Mon Nov 14 14:18:03 EST 2016)
Clojure 1.7.0-master-SNAPSHOT

$ nos repl
Nostrand 0.0.1.6940 (master/a1e4260* Mon Nov 28 03:51:20 EST 2016)
Mono 4.8.0 (mono-4.8.0-branch/f5fbc32 Mon Nov 14 14:18:03 EST 2016)
Clojure 1.7.0-master-SNAPSHOT
REPL 0.0.0.0:11217
user>
```

With a namespace they are searched for using Clojure's normal namespace resolution machinery. The current directory is on the load path by default.

```
$ cat tasks.clj
(ns tasks)

(defn build []
  (binding [*compile-path* "build"]
    (compile 'important.core)
    (compile 'important.util)))

$ nos tasks/build
```

Command line arguments are parsed as EDN passed to the function.

```
$ cat tasks.clj
(ns tasks)

(defn build [utils?]
  (binding [*compile-path* "build"]
    (compile 'important.core)
    (when utils?
      (compile 'important.util))))

$ nos tasks/build true
```

Your entry namespace can also set up your classpath, load assemblies, and eventually manage dependencies.  

```
$ cat tasks.clj
(assembly-load-from "assemblies/SomeLib.dll")
(ns tasks
  (:import [SomeLib SomeType]))

(defn build [utils?]
  (SomeType/DoThing)
  (binding [*compile-path* "build"]
    (compile 'important.core)
    (when utils?
      (compile 'important.util))))

$ nos tasks/build true
```
