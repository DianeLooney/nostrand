# Nostrand
Standalone runtime environment and REPL for ClojureCLR on Mono.

## Status
Very early, pre-alpha. Everything will change. Don't use for anything critical.

## Installing

```
$ git clone https://github.com/nasser/nostrand.git
$ cd nostrand
$ xbuild
$ ln -s ./bin/Debug/nos ~/bin/
$ nos repl
user>
```

## Usage

```
nos FUNCTION [ARGUMENT...]
```

Nostrand does one thing: it runs a function. A function is either a Clojure function, or defined in C#. Some functions are built in.

```
$ nos version
Nostrand 0.0.1.33392 (master/9e61e2f* Wed Jun 22 18:33:04 EDT 2016)
Mono 4.4.1 (mono-4.4.0-branch-c7sr0/4747417 Mon Jun 20 15:43:48 EDT 2016)
Clojure 1.7.0-master-SNAPSHOT

$ nos repl
user> 
```

In the future, you will be able to provide Nostrand with compiled functions written in C#.

But Nostrand is primarly meant to run namespace-qualified Clojure functions.

```
$ cat foo.clj
(ns foo)
(defn bar [] (dotimes [i 5] (println (str "foobar: " i))))
$ nos foo/bar
foobar: 0
foobar: 1
foobar: 2
foobar: 3
foobar: 4
```

Additional command line arguments are passed to the function.

```
$ cat foo.clj
(ns foo)
(defn bar [i]
  (dotimes [j (int i)] (println (str "foobar: " j))))
$ nos foo/bar 10
foobar: 0
foobar: 1
foobar: 2
foobar: 3
foobar: 4
foobar: 5
foobar: 6
foobar: 7
foobar: 8
foobar: 9
```  

The load path is the current directory. Future releases will allow dependency and load path management.
